# Next.js experiments
Example app with the [Next.js framework](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/), a minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications. 

Next.js is a framework well suited for building [Progressive Web Applications](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) because it supports out of the box the following features

* Server Side Rendering
* [Automatic code splitting](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#automatic-code-splitting)
* [Dynamic Import](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#dynamic-import)
* [Prefetching Pages](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/#prefetching-pages)


## Setup
 * Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
 * `cd` into the project directory and run `npm i`
 * run `npm run dev`
 * Enjoy
